Existing buildings and\nstorefronts along Verona Avenue and Main Street should be maintained and\nrehabilitated to support retail and small business activity. Over the long term, new\ncommercial and Mixed Use development may take place on select opportunity\nsites, designed in a way that reinforces Downtown Verona's traditional pedestrianoriented design character and scale. Certain opportunity sites may require the\ntransitioning of industrial-commercial uses to residential or Mixed Use. Permitting\na mix of uses in the Downtown Core will facilitate increased utilization of buildings\nand spaces and build value in Downtown real estate and businesses.\n\nMIXED USE - NEIGHBORHOOD\nNeighborhood Mixed Use districts provide opportunities for both residential and\nindependent and convenience-type retailing and services, such as specialty retail\nstores, dry cleaners, groceries, salons, florists, clinics, and doctor offices, and\ncafes and restaurants. Such developments can include Mixed Use buildings, multibuilding complexes, or small strip centers, offering flexibility for both commercial\nand residential uses within the same block or site. They should also be compatible\nin design and scale with adjacent land uses and feature adequate pedestrian\nconnections and linkages to reduce vehicular use. Neighborhood Mixed Use\ndistricts are located throughout Verona, including land adjacent to the Downtown\nCore and west along Verona Avenue north of Verona High School, and in projected\ngrowth areas east of the U.S. Highways 18 and 151.\n\nRESIDENTIAL - MID DENSITY\nMid-Density Residential districts provide for higher-density residential\ndevelopments near commercial and Mixed Use areas and transportation corridors,\nhelping to promote a range of housing types that meet varying household size and\nincome needs. Such housing types can include a mix of multi-flats, townhomes,\nand multi-family apartment developments. Suitable locations for Mid-Density\nResidential include the growth areas east, south, and southwest of U.S. Highways\n18 and 151, in select land parcels surrounding the Downtown Core, north along\nMain Street, and west along McKee Road. Higher-density residential will also help\nsupport the development of neighborhood commercial areas featuring convenience\nstores, restaurants, and services that meet the daily needs of neighborhood\nresidents. Such developments should have pedestrian linkages to adjacent\ncommercial areas, parks, and open space, and feature compatible design and\narchitecture to surrounding land uses.\n\nRESIDENTIAL - LOW DENSITY\n\nSource: Google Maps\n\nLow-Density Residential neighborhoods, located primarily to the north and\nnorthwest and to the southeast and south of Downtown Verona, are largely\ncharacterized by pre- and post-World War II housing types on quarter-acre lots\nand those of more recent development that form cohesive neighborhoods within\nwalking and driving distance of Downtown and nearby and regional employment\ncenters. This land use designation seeks to preserve and maintain the traditional\nsingle-family character of these neighborhoods by encouraging housing\nmaintenance and rehabilitation, compatible new infill housing, and residential\nsubdivisions appropriate to its context. In the projected growth areas to the east,\nsoutheast, and southwest of U.S. Highways 18 and 151, opportunities exist for\ncreating new single-family neighborhoods that comprise a mix of single-family\nhomes, duplexes, triplexes, and townhomes, thereby providing a broader mix of\ndwelling types in these locations. Duplexes, triplexes, and fourplex housing types\nmay also be permitted as infill housing in established single-family neighborhoods.\n\nDESTINATION COMMERCIAL\nA portion of Verona Avenue at Hometown Circle features Verona’s most significant\nconcentration of both large and small format retail commercial activity, including\nBlaine’s Farm and Fleet, Festival Foods Grocery Store, and chain restaurants,\nwhich attract both local Verona residents and customers from the surrounding\narea. This land use classification also reflects the particular design characteristics\nof these developments, which are single-story in height with deep setbacks from\nthe roadway and large parking areas. Future Destination Commercial development\nis projected for the southwest corner of the U.S. Highways 18 and 151 and State\nTrunk Highway (STH) 69 interchange.\nSource: Google Maps\n\nMIX - INSTITUTIONAL OR COMMERCIAL\nThe Institutional and Commercial district supports a mix of commercial and\ninstitutional uses, focused around the SSM Health Clinic near U.S. Highways 18 and\n151 and State Trunk Highway (STH) 69 interchange. This area of the district offers\nopportunities for medical, office, commercial and service-oriented developments\nthat complements the clinic and serves the surrounding neighborhoods. The\nland use classification reflects the areas emerging role as a Mixed Use node,\naccommodating institutional facilities alongside commercial services within a\nwalkable setting.\nSource: Opsis Architecture\n\nMIX - INDUSTRIAL OR COMMERCIAL\nThe Industrial and Commercial district supports a mix of employment-oriented\nland uses, focused around light industrial, office, and commercial uses. This\nland use classification reflects a district where these uses can co-exist within a\nflexible development framework.

the Epic Systems Corporation campus on Verona’s northwest side\nat North Nine Mound and McKee Roads.\n\nSource: EPIC Website\n\nUTILITIES AND TRANSPORTATION\nThe transportation and utility network includes land devoted to the U.S. and State\nHighways, local roads and arterials, water towers and lift stations, and power and\ntelecommunication lines.\n\nINSTITUTIONAL\nVerona municipal facilities, such as the City Hall, Fire Department, Public Works,\nPublic Library, and Senior Center; other government facilities; schools; and\nreligious buildings and associated cemeteries are categorized as Institutional.\nThe Institutional land use classification allows public or quasi-public entities to\nplan accordingly for the future expansion and location of such facilities.\n\nPARKS\n\nSource: Verona City Website\n\nParks encompass all parks and recreational lands and facilities within Verona,\nincluding those owned and maintained by the City of Verona Parks and Urban\nForestry Department. The intent is to maintain and enhance such areas and their\nfunctions as active centers for recreational activity.\n\nINDUSTRIAL\nIndustrial zones permit a broad range of warehousing, manufacturing, research,\ntechnology, and their office-related activities with minimal environmental impact.\nSuch industries are located in existing industrial zones, such as Liberty Business\nPark and the Verona Technology Park, which offer access to U.S. Highways 18\nand 151 and County Highway (CTH) M, as well as select locations at Paoli, Main,\nand Factory Streets. An area of mixed light industrial-commercial uses, such\nas contractor and contractor-supply businesses, food wholesalers, and small\nmanufacturers — some with outdoor storage requirements — will remain north of\nthe U.S. Highways 18 and 151 and STH 69 interchange at Locust Drive below Bruce\nStreet. More public-facing commercial uses, such as grocery stores, breweries,\nrestaurants, and other retail services, will be permitted in the industrial and\ntechnology parks east of the U.S. Highways 18 and 151. The industrial district will\ncontinue to expand upon the existing Liberty Business Park and Verona Technology\nPark developments.\n\nSource: Visit Verona\n\nOPEN LANDS/ENVIRONMENTAL\nFloodplains and environmentally sensitive lands, trails, lakes, creeks, and natural\nand topographic features comprise key elements of Verona’s “green” infrastructure\nand open space network. An overarching goal of this Future Land Use Strategy is to\ncreate environmental corridors that connect existing parks with new and existing\ntrails, water features, and other open spaces, providing Verona residents with\naccess to greenways and their trail systems from most residential neighborhoods.\nProtecting and enhancing such areas can help to protect natural features and\nwildlife habitats and provide added stormwater management benefits.\n\nENVISION\n\n\fSUBAREAS FOR GROWTH\n\nStation\n\n2\n\nEnvision Verona has identified five primary subareas\nfor future housing growth over the next 30 years.\nKEY SUBAREAS\n\n1.

A consistent critique of the intersection highlighted the need for safer\nand more comfortable pedestrian crossings, and desire for reduced traffic congestion,\nparticularly for north-south travel.\nIntersection improvements in isolation have limited capacity to reduce traffic\ncongestion. The intersection is impacted by City-wide and regional roadway patterns\nand access, and exacerbated by a lack of north-south arterial roadways.

regulatory barriers\nthat limit housing supply and diversity, as well as regulations that\nincrease the cost of housing. This guide supports the implementation of\nthe Dane County Regional Housing Strategy (RHS) by providing practical\ntools to help local governments address the area’s housing crisis.\n\nBest Practices Guide: Main Elements\nPart 1: Zoning Evaluation Checklist\nPart 2: Model Districts, Definitions, and Guidelines\nPart 3: Guide to Streamlining Housing Approvals\n\nDane County is experiencing a housing crisis caused by rapid job and\nhousehold growth, soaring home prices, and decades of underproduction\nof new housing units. In response, the Regional Housing Strategy (RHS) was\ndeveloped as a collaborative effort among local governments, planners, and community stakeholders to identify shared challenges and define\ncoordinated responses. The RHS set an ambitious action plan for the next five years centered around 5 Housing Priorities and 17 Strategic\nActions. Strategy 4 calls for the Region to “Advance Zoning Reforms and Update Local Zoning Codes.” The “Best Practices Guide to\nResidential Zoning” addresses this strategy by providing a workbook for local governments in Dane County to help them consider zoning updates\nthat will increase the supply, diversity, and affordability of housing.\n\nThe Role of Zoning in Housing Supply and Cost Zoning restricts the type of housing allowed to be built, as well as housing size and\nlocation. These restrictions increase development costs, ultimately preventing the construction of many in-demand types of owner- and renteroccupied housing. Zoning was historically used to facilitate racial segregation and continues to disproportionately impact low-income and\nminority communities today. Many zoning codes still reflect a system developed over 100 years ago. Meanwhile, demographics, development\nneeds, and housing preferences have changed. Land and construction costs have far outpaced wage growth, making housing less and less\nattainable. Local governments should review their zoning codes for barriers to housing development to ensure that their land use regulations\nreflect the needs and projected growth of their communities. While factors like labor, materials, and financing costs lie largely outside local\ncontrol, zoning and land use policy remain key tools for local governments to shape future development.\n\nWho Should Use This Guide? This guide should be used by local government planning and zoning practitioners such as community\nplanners and zoning administrators. Conclusions drawn and insights gained from using the guide should be communicated with the local\ngovernment’s elected and appointed officials as well as interested residents and stakeholders to develop the best policies specific to their\ncommunity.\nEvery community is different. This guide is not a checklist of requirements but a good starting point for thoughtful analysis and informed\ndiscussion. By taking a closer look at how zoning works in practice, communities can position themselves to better meet their current and future\nhousing needs, foster equitable access, and long-term community success.

Allow for a variety of housing types\n2. Reduce minimum lot sizes & setbacks\n3. Increase the number of permitted dwelling\nunits by acre\n4. Reduce parking requirements\n5. Allow multi-unit housing by right\n\nThe Zoning Code Evaluation Checklist provides a tool to help municipalities identify and evaluate which code recommendations are best suited\nfor their individual code updates. The checklist is organized around six zoning topics.\n\nHow to Use the Evaluation Checklist\n\nChecklist Topics\n1. Dimensions\n2. Density\n3. Land Use\n4. Parking\n5. Approval Processes\n6. Non-Zoning Guidelines\n\nBest Practices Residential Zoning Code\n\nZoning practitioners should use the Checklist like a workbook, reviewing each evaluation criteria and\ncomparing it to the existing zoning regulation in their communities. The checkbox offers a “yes” or\n“no” choice in response to criteria questions. A “yes” answer generally means the existing regulation\nis relatively aligned with best practices in residential zoning, while a “no” answer is intended to signal\nthat changes may be appropriate.\nThe Checklist is not meant to grade the community on their housing-related regulations but rather to\nidentify areas for improvement. The “zoning best practice” column provides value added information\nto explain how the criteria could specifically be amended to align with metrics and practices that\nsupport increased housing supply and decreased housing costs. Specific numbers and policies\nshould be adjusted by communities to meet their needs and consider local housing, political, and\ngeographic contexts.\n\nPage | 3\n\n\f1.1: Dimensional Requirements\nTopic Overview:\nWhat are dimensional requirements?\nZoning codes use dimensional requirements to regulate the physical size and density of development on a lot including characteristics like lot\nsize, lot width, setbacks, and height. These standards control the form of how a building can fit on a given lot and within the context of its\nsurroundings. These standards dictate how much land can be consumed per housing unit.\nDo dimensional requirements impact housing supply and cost?\nModifying dimensional requirements can dramatically affect the cost of housing. For example, allowing smaller lots can also facilitate a more\ncompact development pattern that consumes less land overall. With smaller lots, the cost of streets and utilities are spread across more\nhousing units and reduce the cost for each individual lot. Compact development patterns can also reduce municipal operating costs with less\npavement for repairs, maintenance, and plowing per household, for example. Overall, adjusting dimensional requirements can drive down the\ncost of a housing unit and increase the supply of housing units for sale or rent.\nWithin each evaluation criteria, a range of options may be available rather than a “one size fits all” approach to zoning districts and zoning\nregulations. Where a range exists, the smallest category is not automatically the “best.” A range is presented to illustrate that different options\nare available. For example, reducing lot sizes below the common traditional 10,000 square foot minimums is best practice. However, minimum\nlot size evaluation should not stop there. The exact mix of zoning districts and minimum lot sizes should be determined according to the\ncommunity’s zoning district make-up and local context.\n\nEvaluation Checklist:\nZoning Requirement\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nExisting Code\nNotes\n\nZoning Best Practice\n\nHousing Affordability Impact\n\n(for Community Use)\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nMinimum Lot Size.

A density limitation is\nusually expressed as a maximum number of dwelling units per acre (e.g., 7 dwelling units/acre). However, other zoning regulations also restrict\nthe density of development on a lot such as Floor Area Ratio (a measure of the building’s gross square footage compared to the lot area) or a\nsimple limitation like the number of dwelling units per building. Density restrictions can be effective in ensuring there is enough capacity in\ninfrastructure (like sanitary and storm sewer) and public services (like police and fire) to serve the development. However, the application of\ndensity restrictions often restricts housing options even when capacity is available to serve the development. Other standards can effectively\nmanage the character, mass, and form of buildings (such as maximum building height and setbacks) without using overly restrictive density\nlimitations.\nHow do density requirements impact housing supply, diversity, and cost?\nWhere density restrictions exist, they limit the overall housing supply, driving up prices for both rentals and owner-occupied units. Land becomes\nmore expensive when density regulations limit how much of it can be used, making it an even more valuable resource, and limiting the supply of\nhousing. Higher land costs are paid for by the homeowner or renter, making housing costs more expensive. Conversely, loosening density\nrestrictions can increase housing supply and help to lower housing costs. Higher density opportunities allow greater housing unit variety which\ncan accommodate different household types, income levels, and different stages of life.\n\nEvaluation Worksheet:\nZoning Requirement\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nExisting Code\nNotes\n\nZoning Best Practice\n\nHousing Affordability Impact\n\n(for Community Use)\n\n1 Maximum Floor Area Ratios\n(FAR).

With higher\nimpervious surfaces, regional\nstormwater may be required. Zoning\npractices should be balanced with\nother development considerations\nlike stormwater management.\nEliminate density maximums.\nInstead, prescribe standards for\nbuilding setbacks and height to\nguide desired development\ncharacter.\n\nGreat coverage promotes more\nefficient use of land. Less land\nconsumption = lower costs.\n\nIn exchange for affordable housing\nunits, bonuses can allow taller\nbuildings or more units (if otherwise\nlimited by the code).\n\nState law prohibits inclusionary\nzoning requirements that mandate\naffordable housing. However,\nzoning may use voluntary\nincentives such as bonuses.\n\nDensity maximums restrict\nhousing supply, which increases\nprices. Limiting density can\nencourage sprawl. More land\nconsumption = higher costs.\n\n1.3: Land Use Requirements\nTopic Overview:\nWhat are land use requirements?\nZoning ordinances define which land uses are allowed within a specific zoning district such as residential or commercial uses. A residential land\nuse category can include multiple different types of housing such as single family detached or attached homes, two-family homes in various\nformats, small scale multi-family buildings like four- or eight-unit apartments, and higher density multi-family buildings like twelve or twenty-unit\napartment buildings. Residential land uses can also include other unique development forms like “Pocket Neighborhood” housing or “Accessory\nDwelling Units.” Within a zoning district, land use requirements are described as “Permitted” or “Conditional Uses.” Permitted uses can occur\n\nBest Practices Residential Zoning Code\n\nPage | 8\n\n\f“by-right,” upon demonstration of compliance with all zoning requirements. Conditional use permits may be allowed only after a public hearing,\nadditional municipal approvals, and potential satisfaction of conditions on the use, increasing the cost and time of development.\nHow do land use requirements impact housing supply, diversity, and cost?\nLimitations on allowed land uses in a zoning district restrict housing development.

The purpose of parking\nrequirements is to ensure there is sufficient parking, typically on-site, to accommodate the expected traffic generated by the development. Some\ncommunities use parking maximums to limit the provision of parking stalls above and beyond the minimum needed. Parking minimums are often\nrelaxed in transit-oriented areas, such as within a quarter mile of a park and ride or transit stop. Aside from municipal parking regulations,\nlenders often require a certain level of parking in order to provide bank financing for the project.\nHow do parking requirements impact housing supply and cost?\nParking requirements must be met to develop housing that complies with a community’s zoning ordinance. Costs associated with parking\nrequirements include the cost to design parking areas and to provide the land needed to accommodate the parking in a driveway or surface lot,\nor in a garage or parking structure. These costs are passed on to the renter or homebuyer. Excessive use of land for parking also consumes land\nthat could instead be used for additional housing units.\n\nEvaluation Checklist:\nZoning Requirement\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nExisting Code\nNotes\n\nZoning Best Practice\n\nHousing Affordability Impact\n\nOlder codes often require 3 spaces\nand might require a garage for these\nhousing types.

Approval can be administrative or\ndiscretionary. Administrative approvals are facilitated by municipal staff after a project demonstrates that the development complies with all\nordinance requirements. Discretionary approvals, such as conditional use permits or rezoning requests, include more intensive review\nprocesses. This often requires public hearings, committee meetings, and final authorization by a governing body. There is greater uncertainty,\n\nBest Practices Residential Zoning Code\n\nPage | 12\n\n\fcost, and time associated with discretionary approvals whereas administrative approvals must be granted for permitted uses that comply with\ncodes and typically require less processing time.\nHow do zoning approval processes impact housing supply and cost?\nAdditional time and uncertainty are a risk to housing developers. More risk can suppress housing development and cause greater lags in\ndeveloping much needed housing supply. The longer and less standardized approvals are, the more cost to the developer that gets passed to the\nfuture homeowner or rental household.\n\nEvaluation Checklist:\nZoning Requirement\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nExisting Code\nNotes\n\nZoning Best Practice\n\nHousing Affordability Impact\n\nZoning codes typically allow\nadministrative approvals of single\nfamily and two-family developments.\nExpand this to allow administrative\napprovals of housing formats up to 812 multi-family units if permitted in\nthe zoning district, without the need\nfor Plan Commission site plan or\narchitectural review.\nCreate zoning districts that reflect\nmodern development and housing\nneeds rather than requiring a lengthy\nPD process.

Zoning influences where and how developments are built based on municipal\nregulations. Many other factors influence housing development and costs including land suitability, labor, building materials, and financing.\nOther municipal ordinances and plans can play a role, too. Subdivision codes, stormwater ordinances, building codes, and Comprehensive\nPlans, for example, work together with zoning to create a regulatory framework for development review. State and municipal programs can also\nimpact housing through incentives, encouragement, and education.\nHow do non-zoning guidelines impact housing supply, diversity, and cost?\nThere are countless ways that the entire regulatory and development framework can impact housing supply and cost. This section of the\nevaluation checklist provides key recommendations related to Comprehensive Plan and Subdivision Code standards relative to alignment with\nzoning recommendations.\n\nEvaluation Checklist:\nZoning Requirement\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nExisting Code\nNotes\n\nZoning Best Practice\n\nHousing Affordability Impact\n\nAssess community housing as a first\nstep to identify issues and demand.

Create\nmixed density and use categories in the\nComprehensive Plan instead of\nexclusive density and use categories\n(e.g., mixed residential vs. SF, TF, MF).\nComprehensive Plans should guide\nzoning decisions and can broadly\nrecommend density thresholds.\nHowever, restrictive density limitations\ncan be a barrier to zoning text and map\namendments.\n\nCommunity conversations around\nhousing can lead to successful\nadoption of zoning amendments\nand/or approval of housing\ndevelopment projects.\nProactively aligning comprehensive\nplan and zoning goals not only\ncomplies with State Law but can\navoid costly delays in entitlement\nreview processes as developments\nare proposed.\nComprehensive Plan policies may\nconflict with zoning goals.\nAmending a Future Land Use map\ncan add months on top of a zoning\nentitlement process.\n\n(for Community Use)\n\n1\n\nHousing Study: a communitywide assessment of housing\nneeds.

Communities should customize the model language to their specific context,\nincluding consideration of local infrastructure, demographics, housing conditions, and\ncommunity goals. The model language provided in this guide includes:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\n2.1 – Model residential zoning districts\n2.2 – Best practice for permitted land uses by zoning district\n2.3 – Incorporating housing into mixed-use zoning districts\n2.5 – Best practice residential parking requirements\n2.6 – Accessory dwelling unit detailed text\n2.7 – Pocket neighborhood detailed text\n2.8 – Definitions for housing types, bulk dimensions, and family\n\nBest Practices Residential Zoning Code\n\nPage | 17\n\n\f2.1: Model Zoning Districts\nEach of the seven model zoning districts aims to provide flexibility and remove barriers to the development of new diverse housing opportunities.\nCommunities may adapt the model districts to best suit their needs. Adoption of a new district should include at least the following key\nelements: (1) a purpose statement, (2) density, intensity, and bulk regulations, and (3) a list of land uses that are permitted or conditional uses.\nThe model districts are designed to be applied in different locations within a single neighborhood, rather than utilizing one district for an entire\nneighborhood. For example, a given neighborhood that includes a mix of single-family, two-family, and multi-family housing types would apply a\npattern of different zoning districts to enable each housing type.\nTo increase options available to a community, Model District E is designed to allow for broader application of a single zoning district across a\nlarger geographic area while enabling multiple housing types with varying dimensions. This avoids the need to rezone individual groups of lots if\nthe lots can comply with the dimensional standards for the given type of housing.\nWhile each local government will determine how to use the districts, an ideal\noutcome would be a neighborhood that contains a mix of housing types and zoning\ndistricts. Zoning decisions should be guided by careful neighborhood planning and\ndesign to support community goals for neighborhood development.\n\nModel Districts\nDistrict A: Pocket Neighborhood\n\nWhen should a community amend their zoning code?\n\nDistrict B: Small Lot Alley-Loaded\n\nKey indicators that zoning revisions are necessary include:\n• The code no longer reflects the community’s vision\n• The code fails to address current needs and challenges\n• The code is outdated or obsolete, reflecting development practices that don’t\nmatch modern needs\n• The code is frequently challenged in disputes or litigation\n• The code is difficult to interpret, and information is hard to find\n• The code doesn’t reflect new planning policies\n\nDistrict C: Small Lot Front-Loaded\n\nShould a community revise or rewrite their entire zoning code?\n\nDistrict D: Medium Lot Residential\nDistrict E: Mixed Middle\nDistrict F: Medium Multi-Family\nResidential\nDistrict G: Medium-High Multi-Family\nResidential\n\nFirst, a community should complete an evaluation of their zoning code to assess\nbarriers to housing development using the Checklist in Part 1 of this guide. In addition, the community should evaluate how the zoning code is\nfunctioning overall, considering key indicators listed above. Depending on the functionality of the current code, targeted amendments may be\nsufficient such as incorporation of one or two new zoning districts or adjustment of bulk regulations within existing zoning districts. In other\ncases, a full rewrite may be necessary to rework the mix of zoning districts. In either case it will be important to have consistency throughout the\nentire code. A zoning code rewrite should include ample time and resources to adequately address community needs and should ideally be\nbased on feedback developed during a broader planning process.\nBest Practices Residential Zoning Code\n\nPage | 18\n\n\fDistrict A: Pocket Neighborhood\nPurpose Statement: Pocket Neighborhoods are comprised of small residential buildings that may\n\nDistrict Image Example\n\nbe made of detached, attached, or townhouse units.

Conditional Use\nPermitted land uses are those authorized “by-right” in a zoning district. If a development meets all\nrequirements in the ordinance, the land use may obtain a zoning permit. Allowing more projects by-right\ncan greatly reduce administrative burden, provide greater predictability for developers, and expedite the\nlocal entitlement process.\nBest practices include by-right housing at various scales, formats, and price points. Single-family and\ntwo-family housing types are typically exempt from site plan approval requirements. This should be\nexpanded to exempt additional housing types like townhomes for example, where appropriate, or allow\nfor administrative (staff level) site plan review and approval. Allowing specific housing types by-right\nhelps to increase the supply of much needed housing.\nModel Residential Zoning Districts\nA: Pocket\nNeighborhood\n\nB: Small Lot\nAlleyLoaded\n\nC: Small Lot\nFront-Loaded\n\nD: Medium\nLot\n\nE: Mixed\nMiddle\n\nSingle Family (Detached)\n\n✓\n\n✓\n\n✓\n\n✓\n\n✓\n\nTwo-Flats (Stacked)\n\n✓\n\n✓\n\n✓\n\n✓\n\n✓\n\n✓\n\nLand Uses (See Definitions in Section 2.7)\n\nPermitted Land Uses\n\nDuplex (Side by Side)\nTwin Home (Zero Lot Line)\n\n✓\n\nTownhome (2+ Attached)\n\n✓\n\nMultiplex (3+ Individual Entry)\n\n✓\n\n✓\n\n✓\n\nF: Medium\nMulti-Family\n\nG: MediumHigh MultiFamily\n\n✓\n\n✓\n\n✓\n\n✓\n\n✓\n\n✓\n\n✓\n\n✓\n\n✓\n\n✓\n\n✓\n\n✓\n\n✓\n\n✓\n\n✓\n\n✓\n\n✓\n\n✓\n\n✓\n\n✓\n\nApartments (3+ Common\nEntry)\nNonresidential\nAccessory Dwelling Units\n\nBest Practices Residential Zoning Code\n\n✓\n\n✓\n\n✓\n\nPage | 26\n\n\f2.3: Incorporating Housing into Mixed-Use Zoning Districts\nThis section is oriented to infill and redevelopment sites that may be suitable for new housing. As every community’s zoning districts will differ\ngreatly, the recommended approach for enabling residential into already-developed parts of the community is to conduct a review of existing\ndistricts and incorporate mixed use buildings and freestanding residential as permitted uses into existing zoning districts.\n\nIncorporating Mixed Use Development\nIn many communities, commercial zoning districts do not allow any type of\nresidential land use, or they significantly restrict residential land uses. In many\ninstances, areas zoned for commercial land uses meet all the criteria for\nsuccessful implementation of multi-family housing and mixed-use\ndevelopment. Encouraging residential development in these areas also brings\nresidents closer to desired amenities and reduces the transportation impacts\nof new housing. Allowing by right multi-family and mixed-use in commercial\nareas is another important strategy in reducing the cost of housing.\nThe following list of “mixed use” buildings could be added to as permitted land\nuses within existing commercial zoning districts to enable residential opportunities throughout the community – including along commercial\ncorridors or in established downtown and village centers. Standalone residential developments are\nbest accomplished by rezoning, using one or more of the model residential zoning districts provided\nabove.\n(1)\n\nMulti-Family with Limited Commercial: A mixed-use building which contains residential and\none or more principal nonresidential land uses on the ground floor.\n(a)\n\n(2)\n\nThe principal nonresidential use shall be limited to the ground floor of the building and shall\nconsist of a minimum of 33 percent of the gross floor area of the ground floor. This includes\na shared lobby or entryway space for residential and nonresidential uses. On-site vehicle\nparking and access may not exceed 25 percent of the gross floor area of the ground floor.\nThis includes vehicle parking and access for both residential and nonresidential uses.\n\nMixed Use Building: A building containing a mix of principal nonresidential land uses and\nprincipal residential land uses.\n(a)\n\nThe principal non-residential use shall consist of a minimum of 50 percent of the gross floor\narea of the ground floor (including shared lobby spaces). This includes a shared lobby or entryway space for residential and\nnonresidential uses.

and nonresidential uses.\n\nBest Practices Residential Zoning Code\n\nPage | 27\n\n\f(3)\n\nLive/Work Building: A multi-unit building, typically arranged in a townhouse format, in which each unit\ncontains a commercial use on the ground floor with a residential use on upper floors, with both uses\ntypically occupied by the same resident/business operator, but not required. The commercial space may or\nmay not be interconnected to the residential use with an internal stair or elevator.\n(a)\n\nThe live/work building is typically the primary dwelling of the occupant.\n\n(b)\n\nThe nonresidential component of the live/work building is limited to the following land uses, but only if\nsuch uses are also permitted by right or by conditional use permit in the applicable zoning district:\n1. Office\n2. Service and Sales\n3. Artisan Production Shop\n\nIncorporating Standalone Residential Uses\nCommunities should conduct a review of their existing zoning districts – particularly commercial and downtownoriented districts – and consider adding standalone multi-family land uses as permitted uses. Standalone refers\nto the entire property/building being used for single land use type, rather than a mix of land\nuse types. Alternatively, if the community wishes to have a finer degree of control over where\nmulti-family uses are located, communities could amend their zoning map to apply one or\nmore of the residential zoning districts in Section 2 to specific sites that have been identified\nfor residential use. Use of these zoning districts should be consistent with surrounding\ndevelopment, good planning practices, and the community’s Comprehensive Plan.\n\nBest Practices Residential Zoning Code\n\nPage | 28\n\n\f2.4: Design Guidelines\nWhat are design guidelines?\nZoning codes provide a broad framework for land use and dimensional requirements. Design guidelines offer more specific details on how\nbuildings should be designed based on the land use framework and context provided in the zoning code. Design guidelines specify requirements\nfor structures such as building materials, façade treatments, building orientation, mass and character requirements, landscaping, lighting or\nother aesthetic or architectural character details.\n\nHow do design guidelines impact housing supply and cost?\nPros: Design guidelines offer predictability for developers and communities. With clear expectations, guidelines reduce conflict and uncertainty\nin the development process. They also help to streamline approvals for projects that meet design standards and help keep the costs of\ndevelopment down if they remain clear, simple, and minimal.\nCons: Design requirements for certain building materials or building designs add to housing cost and limit options available to developers and\noften makes housing unattainable for future homeowners. Time and uncertainty in the development review process are also a costly risk to\nhousing developers and can delay projects and cause re-designs. Greater risk will suppress housing development or cause greater lags in\ndeveloping needed housing supply.\nBest practices in design regulation will find an appropriate balance between prescribing design requirements that are easy to interpret, limited,\nreasonable, understand the community goals, and consider the cost of impact to housing.\nSome examples:\n• Building Orientation: Where possible, homes should face the primary street with a visible front door or entryway.\n• Materials: Use a consistent and durable material palette (e.g. wood, fiber cement, stucco, brick, siding). Limit highly reflective surfaces. No\nmore than two primary exterior materials per elevation.\n• Windows and Doors: Front facades should have windows and doors that are proportionate to the wall area. Blank walls facing a “Main\nStreet” are not allowed.\n• Privacy and Setbacks: second-story windows facing adjacent backyards must be setback at least 10 feet from the rear property line. Fences\nand hedges in front yards must not exceed 3 feet in height.\nConclusion: Guidelines may vary slightly between different types of housing but should not be over burdensome because of the potential for\nadded delays and costs, which limits housing supply and increases the sale price. These kinds of guidelines can be adopted as part of a formbased code, a design overlay district, or simply added to existing zoning regulations. They strike a balance between control and flexibility,\nensuring that new development fits without being overly burdensome.\n\nBest Practices Residential Zoning Code\n\nPage | 29\n\n\f2.5: Best Practices Residential Parking Requirements\nMinimum parking requirements, often established many decades ago, greatly influence the cost of construction.\nOne method of reducing development costs and enhancing the livability of the built environment is by reducing\nminimum parking requirements and/or establishing maximum parking requirements. Many communities across the\ncountry have removed minimum parking requirements altogether, leaving it up to the developer/property owner to\ndetermine their own parking needs.\nBelow are model residential parking requirements by land use types that are defined in Section 2.13. These\nminimum parking spaces represent a reduction from common minimums used in area zoning codes today. Parking\nminimums are often relaxed in transit-oriented areas, such as within a quarter mile of a park and ride or transit stop.\nParking maximums are often used to encourage more efficient use of space and plan for greater densities of\ndevelopment. However, parking maximums may also add burden to housing processes or conflict with lending\npractices as many financing institutions may have minimum parking thresholds needed to provide a loan.\nLand Use Type\n\nMinimum Number of Parking Spaces\n\nSingle Family Dwelling Unit\n\n1 per dwelling unit\n\nDuplex, Twin Home, or Two Flat\n\n1 per dwelling unit\n\nTownhome\n\n1 per dwelling unit\n\nMultiplex or Apartment\n\n1 per dwelling unit\n\nMixed Use Buildings\n\n50% reduction of minimum parking required for all land uses\n\nLive/Work Buildings\n\n50% reduction of minimum parking required for all land uses\n\nAccessory Dwelling Unit\n\n0 per dwelling unit (no more than required for the principal unit)\n\nPocket Neighborhoods\n\n1 per dwelling unit\n\nBest Practices Residential Zoning Code\n\nPage | 30\n\n\f2.6: Best Practices Accessory Dwelling Unit Text\nAdding Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) as permitted uses is a method for enabling diverse residential development. ADUs can be rental or\nowner-occupied and enable new housing units within both new and established neighborhoods.

a street is called a side street lot line. A\nside lot line separating a lot from another lot is called an interior side\nlot line. An interior side lot line can be created with no side yard\nsetback where a building envelope between two lots sharing a single\nstructure is present. This is known as a zero lot line.\nLot line, street side: Any lot line which abuts a public or private\nstreet right-of-way which is not the front lot line (see also lot line,\nfront).\nLot line, zero: An interior side lot line with no side yard setback\nwhere a building envelope between two lots sharing a single\nstructure is present.\n\nBest Practices Residential Zoning Code\n\nLot width: The maximum horizontal distance between the side lot\nlines of a lot, measured parallel to the front lot line(s) at the required\nfront yard setback (see minimum lot width).\nMinimum lot area: The minimum size lot permitted within the\nspecified zoning district.\nMinimum lot width: The smallest permissible lot width for the\napplicable zoning district.\nMinimum setback: The narrowest distance permitted from a street,\nside, or rear property line to a structure.\nMinimum porch setback: The shortest distance between the porch\nand the nearest point on the front yard lot line. The post of the porch\nclosest to a lot line is considered the wall for setback purposes.\nPavement Setback: The area between the nearest right-of-way or\nlot line and any impervious surfaces on the lot. This setback does\nnot apply to driveways, driveway entrances, public sidewalks, or\nsidewalks perpendicular to the street right-of-way on private\nproperty.\nSetback: The shortest distance between the exterior of a building or\nstructure and the nearest point on the referenced lot line, excluding\npermitted projections.\nYard: An open space, other than a court, on a lot unoccupied and\nunobstructed from the ground upward except as otherwise provided\nin this Chapter.\nYard, front: A yard extending across the full width of the lot, the\ndepth of which is the minimum horizontal distance between the\nfront lot line and the setback line parallel thereto on the lot.\nYard, rear: A yard extending across the full width of the lot, the\ndepth of which is the minimum distance between the rear lot line\nand the setback line parallel thereto on the lot.\n\nPage | 36\n\n\fYard, side: A yard extending from the front yard to the rear yard, the\nwidth of which is the minimum horizontal distance between the side\nlot line and the setback line parallel thereto on the lot.\nYard, street side: For corner lots, the yard between the front and\nrear lot lines, extending from the street side lot line to the nearest\npart of the nearest building or structure.\n\nFamily Definition\nFamily: A family is one of the following:\na) An individual; or,\nb) Any number of people related by blood, marriage, domestic\npartnership, legal adoption, guardianship, or other duly\nauthorized custodial relationship, and up to five (5) unrelated\npersons, all of whom live together as a single nonprofit\nhousekeeping unit and share common living, sleeping, cooking,\nand eating facilities; or,\nc) Up to five (5) unrelated people living together as a single\nhousekeeping unit and sharing common living, sleeping,\ncooking, and eating facilities.\nIn addition to those described above, up to two (2) personal\nattendants who provide services for persons with disabilities\ndescribed in (a) through (c) for the purposes of the Fair Housing\nAmendment Act (FHAA) or the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)\nshall be considered part of a family.

Which\nexisting zoning districts work well for enabling cost-effective housing development? Are zoning district adjustments needed to enable certain\nland uses or forms of housing? Do existing parking requirements match your land use and housing goals or do they present barriers? Are there\nclear code revision priorities that could present more housing opportunities in your community? What steps are needed to implement priority\nactions?\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nBest Practices Residential Zoning Code\n\nPage | 38\n\n\f3\nGuide to Streamlining Housing Approvals\n\nTo address the significant increase in housing prices and address the housing shortage in Dane County it is important to not only consider adding\na variety of housing types and sizer and updating local zoning codes. Communities also have an important opportunity to consider streamlining\ntheir housing approvals and create greater efficiencies for local committees, staff, and developers. Communities may improve their zoning\nreview processes by addressing inefficiencies or unnecessary complexities. Improvements can make housing development more transparent,\nclear, and efficient for developers, review bodies, and the public. By providing simplified checklists and guides, allowing for administrative\napprovals, simplifying application requirements, and coordinating committee reviews, reduced time and greater efficiency can be gained and\nbring forward much needed housing.\nWhile municipal zoning practices play a large role in housing development, they are not the only influencing factor. Even with modernized zoning\ncodes and efficient processes, housing development may still be impacted by other factors including financing, labor, material costs, land\nconstraints, and by the preferences and practices of the developer themselves. Opportunities for streamlining housing approvals should be\nevaluated and implemented where possible to contribute to an efficient development review systems overall.\nPart 3 discusses four ways communities can streamline their housing approvals:\n•\n•\n•\n\n3.1 – Development Review Guide. Simplify the development review and communication process.\n3.2 – Minimize use of PUDs. Create standard zoning districts that allow a greater variety of housing types by right.\n3.3 – Development Review Team. Coordinate municipal staff reviews, schedules, and communication.\n\n•\n\n3.4 – Third Party Development Review. Use external review services for specific services or time periods to avoid delays.\n\nBest Practices Residential Zoning Code\n\nPage | 39\n\n\f3.1: Development Review Guides\nZoning codes are not always accessible documents.

addition,\nhousing developers often work in multiple different jurisdictions which have their own\nunique set of regulations to understand, adding to the time it takes them to become\naccustomed to the community’s specific processes. From the public’s perspective,\nresidents often have interest in housing developments proposed in their\nneighborhoods but may lack an understanding of the municipality’s zoning authority or\nprocesses in reviewing such projects, partly due to the inaccessible nature of zoning\ncodes.\nA Development Review Guide is a document that outlines the procedures and\nrequirements for reviewing development proposals in a much simpler format than a\nzoning code. Unlike a zoning code, a development review guide typically uses\nsimplified language and formatting such as lists, bullet points, and graphics, to distill\nregulatory language into easily digestible snapshots of information. Having a\ndevelopment review guide can streamline housing development review by clarifying\nrequired steps from early stages of project concepts and eliminating uncertainties or\nmisunderstandings.\n\nCase Studies: City of Fitchburg and\nCity of Monona, WI\nThe cities of Fitchburg and Monona both\nhave color illustrated development review\nguides that summarize all processes\nrelated to zoning and development\nreview. The documents are hyperlinked\non the Planning Department home page\nfor easy access. The guides may be\nprovided as links in emails, handed out in\npre-applications meetings, and reviewed\nonline by interested parties. Each guide\nbreaks review processes down into lists\nand adds information that the zoning\ncode does not, such as an estimated\ntimeframe to complete a process.\n\nCity of Fitchburg Development Guide\nhttps://www.fitchburgwi.gov/DocumentCenter/View/27670/Development-Guide-Revised\nCity of Monona Development Procedures Manual\nhttps://www.mymonona.com/DocumentCenter/View/10589/FINAL_Planning-and-Community-DevelopmentProcedures_620\n\nBest Practices Residential Zoning Code\n\nPage | 40\n\n\f3.2: Minimizing Use of PUDs\nEuclidean zoning was recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court as a constitutional\napproach to land development regulation in 1926. This zoning system divides a\nmunicipality into specific districts dedicated to a particular land use type and sets\nuniform development restrictions to each development allowed in that district.\nMany communities have zoning codes that are based on the Euclidean framework\nfrom this era resulting in mis-matched regulation of modern development via a\n100-year-old system.\nSome innovations have been made in response to issues that arose from the\ntraditional Euclidean approach, however those also have their own critiques.\nPlanned Development (PD) Zoning, for example, is a zoning technique developed in\nthe 1960s to combat the rigid division of land into specific use districts with\ninflexible dimensional requirements. Developers were allowed to propose a\ncustomized zoning district through extended negotiations with the municipality to\naccommodate the needs of their specific project in exchange for community\nbenefit. PD zoning has allowed many developments to obtain necessary\nentitlements but has also resulted in belabored, costly, and time-intensive zoning\nprocesses that are also highly unpredictable for the developer, decision makers,\nand the public.\nAdvocates for zoning reform recommend creating zoning districts that\naccommodate modern development types by-right, rather than requiring the\nlengthier customization of a Planned Development District.\n\nBest Practices Residential Zoning Code\n\nCase Study: City of Middleton, WI\nThe City of Middleton undertook a full zoning\ncode rewrite and adopted a new zoning code in\n2024. Many housing developments approved by\nthe city under the old code required Planned\nDevelopment zoning because none of the\nstandard zoning districts accommodated the\nexact form, use, density, or layout of\ndevelopment that was proposed to occur. In\nmany cases, the housing development proposed\nwas approved, but only after a lengthy, negotiated\nPlanned Development review process, even\nthough they were generally accepted by the\nreviewing parties involved.\nAs part of the zoning rewrite project, the city\nreviewed projects with PD zoning, along with best\npractices in zoning reform, and adopted new\ndistricts that allow similar developments to\nproceed with much more predictable review\nsteps and standards. Under the old code, a\nproject proposed as a Planned Development\ncould take a minimum of eight city committee\nmeetings. Under the new code, a similar project\nis approved after only 3 meetings.\n\nPage | 41\n\n\f3.3: Development Review Team\nIn many cases, even the best zoning codes cannot substitute for the benefits of\nhaving access to local staff and government leaders to discuss the details of a\ndevelopment proposal or process. A Development Review Team (DRT) is a\ngroup of municipal staff members who meet regularly to review and facilitate\ndevelopment proposals within the municipality, guiding them through the\nnecessary steps to obtain approvals. The DRT provides an accessible point of\ncontact for developers that offers multiple benefits to all parties involved.\nMany communities in Wisconsin and across the country use a DRT framework in\ntheir regular municipal operations. The specifics vary by place and local\ncapacity. The following components should be considered in developing a\nmodel for a successful DRT:\n1) Streamline the process\n•\n•\n•\n\nCreate a single coordinated process involving multiple departments and\na dedicated DRT meeting time\nDevelop clear procedure manuals such as forms to request a meeting\nwith the DRT or checklists for productive discussions with the DRT\nDocument meeting notes and establish a routine for sharing feedback\nduring and after the meeting\n\nDevelopment Review Team Benefits\n•\n•\n\n•\n•\n•\n\n•\n•\n\nEnsure compliance with zoning regulations\nProtect community interests including\ncompliance with the local Comprehensive\nPlan\nPromote quality and consistency via a\npredicable review process\nEnhance collaboration with other municipal\ndepartments and developers\nFacilitate efficient review and\ncommunication, saving time and avoiding redesigns\nSupport informed decision making\nIdentify potential issues early on\n\n2) Establish the right team\n•\n•\n\nInclude department leaders with diverse expertise including planning, engineering, economic development, and parks\nDefine team member roles including the primary point of contact, agenda manager, meeting facilitator, and recorder\n\n3) Leverage technology\n•\n•\n•\n\nAllow applicants to attend meetings in-person or via virtual meeting platforms to maximize efficiency and accessibility\nSave electronic copies of submitted applications and be prepared to share and discuss them during the meeting\nUse a centralized tracking system to organize applications as they advance through the review process\n\nEvaluation Questions:\nDoes your community have a Development Review Team? Do you have a guide or checklist with which to efficiently review each proposal? Do\nyou have the necessary staff capacity, expertise, and resources to ensure the most efficient and successful review outcomes?\n\nBest Practices Residential Zoning Code\n\nPage | 42\n\n\f3.4: Third Party Development Review\nThird-party development review refers to an independent assessment of a development project by an external party contracted by the\nmunicipality. Third- party involvement can improve efficiency by outsourcing compliance checks of a development against adopted municipal\nregulations. In addition, such reviews could increase quality control since the third-party reviewer may be tasked with related specific tasks and\nmay possess specialized knowledge in compliance review.\nBy comparison, a municipal staff person in a smaller community often wears multiple hats and their limited time can be pulled in competing\ndirections, which may result in review delays or inconsistencies.

process to expedite review and\narrive at issuance of building permits faster. Plan review services can also help fill scheduling gaps to avoid disruptions in municipal review\nprocesses. Examples might include anticipated parental leave, FMLA absences, staff turnover periods, or staff training or scheduled vacation\nabsences.\nMany communities use variations of third-party review services. Some may outsource the entire development review process with the\ncommunity ultimately receiving a review letter and a recommendation to issue a permit or not. Other communities outsource specific\ncomponents of development review such as stormwater compliance. Some communities rely on consultant services to cover all aspects of their\nplanning and zoning needs rather than only compliance checks. Third party services may be contracted to public entities such as regional\nplanning agencies or County divisions, or they may be contracted to consultant firms in engineering, planning, building inspection or\narchitecture.\nThird party development review may also benefit the permitting process which often deals with addressing conditions of approval, payment of\nfees, and other administrative requirements after a development project obtains approvals from the local governmental body and committees.\nIdeally, developers will be able to work with municipal staff to satisfy outstanding conditions and administrative requirements within six months\nof final approval by the local governmental body. It is important that municipalities have sufficient staff resources, software, and processes for\nclearing conditions attached to zoning approvals.\n\nThird-Party Review Considerations\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nPotential cost savings from limited contractor services\nIncreased efficiency by streamlining compliance tasks and redistributing time for local staff\nServices may be used intermittently during periods of high permit volume, staff turnover, or scheduled staff absences\nServices may be targeted to a specific development component such as stormwater, engineering, or infrastructure review\nProvide a detailed list of what is to be included in the development review report to ensure transparency, accountability, and\nthat each of the regulations have been met.\n\nBest Practices Residential Zoning Code\n\nPage | 43\n\n\f3.5: Notes\nStreamlining Housing Approvals\nThis page is provided as a worksheet to help you summarize your findings regarding streamlining processes for housing approvals.

Commission\n\nFrom: Katherine Holt – Community Development Specialist\nDate: December 31, 2024\nRe:\n\nComprehensive Plan\n\nIn Wisconsin, municipalities such as the City of Verona are required to have a\nComprehensive Plan as required by Wisconsin State Statute 66.1001 to provide a guide\nfor future development. As part of the process of adopting a Comprehensive Plan, the\nState Statute requires the following for a Public Participation Plan (“PPP”).\n“The governing body of a local governmental unit shall adopt written\nprocedures that are designed to foster public participation, including open\ndiscussion, communication programs, information services, and public\nmeetings for which advance notice has been provided, in every stage of\nthe preparation of a comprehensive plan. The written procedures shall\nprovide for wide distribution of proposed, alternative, or amended\nelements of a comprehensive plan and shall provide an opportunity for\nwritten comments on the plan to be submitted by members of the public to\nthe governing body and for the governing body to respond to such written\ncomments. The written procedures shall describe the methods the\ngoverning body of a local governmental unit will use to distribute\nproposed, alternative, or amended elements of a comprehensive plan to\nowners of property, or to persons who have a leasehold interest in\nproperty pursuant to which the persons may extract nonmetallic mineral\nresources in or on property, in which the allowable use or intensity of use\nof the property is changed by the comprehensive plan”.\nMKSK, the consultant, met with City Staff and the Comprehensive Plan Task Force\n(“Task Force”) in November to kick-off the process, tour the City, and gain feedback\nregarding their draft PPP. The PPP was created initially based on MKSK experiences in\nother communities on what worked best or didn’t work well. MKSK amended their draft\nproposal to include comments from City Staff and the Task Force such as how to\nengage different age brackets in the City and people who may or may not attend\nevents. One comment from both groups is to involve Mara Trusty, Communications\n\n\fManager, throughout this process. The goal of the PPP is to keep this high-level with\nthe understanding that the document will be tweaked as items in the PPP are\nimplemented. If a participation proposal does not work well, this may be either removed\nfor future implementation or tweaked to try it again. The PPP was created to be a guide\non how to gain input from people within and outside of the existing City of Verona\nboundary.\n\nRecommendation:\nStaff recommend the Plan Commission recommend the Common Council approve the\nCity of Verona Public Participation Plan for the Comprehensive Plan.\n\n\fCity of Verona, WI\nVerona Comprehensive Plan\n\nPUBLIC PARTICIPATION PLAN\nDraft Date: December 17, 2024\nThe community engagement process will include a mix of digital engagement, in-person events,\ntask force meetings, technical advisory committee meetings, and stakeholder meetings. The\nguiding principles for community engagement and outreach are listed below.\n1. Make it Meaningful: Engagement is a primary input for plan recommendations. The public\nengagement strategy and schedule is geared to be deliberate, inclusive, and align with the\noverall schedule to directly inform the recommendations in the plan.\n2. Diverse Public Touchpoints: Public engagement is not a one-size-ﬁts-all approach. The\nproject team recommends a variety of engagement events, times, and locations. Along with\nsupplementary digital engagement, this more varied approach will create more\nopportunities for residents to engage with the planning process.\n3. Go to the Experts: Key city staff and stakeholders throughout the planning process will\nprovide local perspective and guidance. The project team will work with the City to identify\nthe key groups, community leaders, and knowledge holders who will help ﬁll in advisory and\nknowledge gaps.\n4. Keep it Simple: Comprehensive planning is complex, but communications don’t need to\nbe. The project team will use simple and direct communication strategies to educate the\npublic on the impact, outcomes, and process for the comprehensive plan.\n\nWhat is the timeline for engagement?\nThe team is centering the Community Engagement strategy around 2 primary phases of work:\n•\n•\n\nListen.™ .Learn.(through.Spring.868❶)¿Listening to community members and knowledge\nholders across the City, and building a base understanding of the State of the Community.\nReveal.™ .Reﬁne¿.(through.868❶)¿Sharing recommendations and testing ideas, and garnering\nfeedback to guide the reﬁnement of recommendations.\n\nHow will the public be able to inform the plan?\n•\n•\n•\n\n•\n\nTwo (2) In-Person Public Open House Events\nAdditional in-person Pop-ups to align with community events\nWebsite, including:\no Online mapping tool to understand community assets and challenges\no Two (2) Online Surveys or Questionnaires\no Public Comment Tool\no Direct Comment Tool (sends a private message)\no Public Comment on Draft Plan\nTargeted Stakeholder Group Conversations, see above\n1\n\n\fCity of Verona, WI\nVerona Comprehensive Plan\nHow will engagement opportunities be advertised?\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nProject Website, which will include the engagement calendar up to date\nSocial Media\nUtility Bill Inserts\nEmail Lists\nNewsletters\nPosters or postcards that can be put up in public locations and distributed\n\nENGAGEMENT & EVENTS\nTask Force Meetings\nThe project team will conduct up to four (4) meetings with the task force.

Verona is a\nbedroom community to Madison, WI, is home to Epic\nSystems Corporation, boasts a great school district, and\nis a safe and well-serviced community.\nThe City of Verona is a rich mosaic of people, homes,\nopen space, commerce, transportation, and community\namenities, and much, much more. This section\ndocuments the existing conditions of the City of Verona\nand how it has changed over the past decade of growth.\nThe spatial and demographic characteristics of the City\nform the backbone of future land use, transportation,\nand policy recommendations.\n\n48\n\nState of Community Report\n\n\fCommunity Profile | Profile of Verona\n\nTHE CITY AT A GLANCE\nThe facts below provide a quick summary of the\nCity of Verona today. Each of these topics is covered\nin more depth on the following pages.\nPeople & Growth\n1. Verona’s population is growing, with both older and younger residents.\n2. Verona has gained more female residents and household sizes have decreased.\n3. Verona’s median income is rising and has remained above the Dane County average income.\n\nLand Use\n4. Verona has quickly added housing, but development has primarily focused on 1-bedroom or 4+ bedroom\nhomes.\n5. A majority of new housing units developed are multi-family.\n\nHousing\n6. Housing costs and the cost burden of renting have increased, and a majority of new residents in Verona are\nrenters.\n\nQuality of Life\n7. Verona is a regional center for trails and parks but has limited neighborhood access to trails.\n\nTransportation & Utilities\n8. Verona has crash hot spots along major corridors and rush hour traffic is concentrated along Verona Ave.\n\nMarket & Economy\n9. 90% of local Verona workers do not live in Verona, and jobs within the City are dominated by information and\ntechnology, largely impacted by the ongoing growth of Epic Systems Corporation.\n10. Epic drives job growth, but other sectors outside of technology have grown, including Retail, Accommodation &\nFood Services, Business Support Services, and Manufacturing.\n\nEnvision Verona Comprehensive Plan\n\n49\n\n\fCommunity Profile | People & Growth\n\nPEOPLE & GROWTH\nPOPULATION GROWTH\nSince 1960, Verona’s population growth (+854%) has far\n\nYear\n\nsurpassed the growth rate of the Madison MSA (+100%),\n\nCity of Verona Madison MSA Dane County\n\nDane County (+153%), Wisconsin (+49%), and the United\n\n1960\n\n1,500\n\n454,400\n\n222,100\n\nStates (+85%).

Changes in age, sex, household\nsize, and income all point to shifting needs and priorities\nfor City residents.\n\nAge\n\nPopulation by Sex\nWomen make up 55% of the City’s population, which\nrepresents a significant shift over the past decade.

This increase is mostly due to the share of those\naged 65+ rising from 10% in 2010 to 13% in 2020 and to\nthe 25-54 age group declining in share from 47% to 40%\n\nFemale\n\nduring that same period.

In particular, the number of unmarried\nhouseholds (single households) has increased 2x the\nrate of married households. The average household\nsize has decreased since 2010, as has the average\nfamily size - both trends seen on a national level. This\nis at least somewhat attributable to the increase in the\nnumber of studio and one-bedroom apartments being\nconstructed in the for-rent market.\nFigure 12: Population by Age\nEnvision Verona Comprehensive Plan\n\n51\n\n\fCommunity Profile | People & Growth\n\nIncome\n\nEmployment Trends\n\nThe last notable trend is in household earnings, which\n\nVerona has a very low unemployment rate at 4%,\n\nsaw an increase of 22% in the last decade.

Opportunity does exist to lean into pill-coating\nand pill-coating-adjacent industries, as the value per\npallet is higher than something like furniture, and the\nfact that the Madison market ranks as one of the top 25\nin the U.S. for tech talent, according to a CBRE report.\nWith the labor currently in the market, it’s plausible\nthese biotech manufacturing and pharmaceutical\ncompanies can grow this industry as one of Verona’s key\nexport-oriented industries.\n\nindustrial facilities that can be built in either community\nwill remain low while opportunity still exists in Madison,\nwhich has a larger workforce available, a much higher\nvolume of space for users to move into, and significantly\nbetter export opportunities with both proximity to\ninterstates 90 and 94 and the airport.\n\nIndustrial Market Implications\nVerona’s industrial market has remained stagnant over\nthe last decade and a half. This is unlikely to change\nwith its current position adjacent to Madison. Since\n2007, Verona saw five new industrial facilities built and\nfour closed, resulting in minimal changes in leasing\ndeals and absorption. Despite Verona’s stagnation, Dane\nCounty saw major growth of industrial space in 2024,\nwith a positive absorption of 1.6M SF. This development\nhas primarily taken place in East Dane County. In\nconversations with local brokers about the industrial\nmarket, current demand for industrial in the market\nis not significant enough to spur any significant spec\nindustrial construction, so it is likely that in the nearterm, new construction will be build-to-suit and will\nbe relatively small in scale when compared to larger\nmarkets.\n\n60\n\nState of Community Report\n\n\fCommunity Profile | Existing Land Use and Market Conditions\n\nPLEASANT VIEW RD\n\nMap 16: Industrial Land Uses\n\nY\nRA\n\nMO\n\nND\n\nRD\n\nCITY OF MADISON\n\nT\nNOR HE R N\nLIGHTS RD\n\nMAPLE GROVE RD\n\nMCKEE RD\n\nCROSS COUNTRY RD\n\nNI\n\nN\n\nE MO\n\nU\n\n18\n\nND R D\n\nMAIN ST\n\nPD\n\nVERO\n\nNA A\n\nVE\n\n18\n\nSouth of Verona Ave.\nalong S.

The\ncomprehensive plan guides the future land use\nwithin the City of Verona and helps to inform land use\ndecisions made by City staff. Residential and outdoor\nrecreation make up the largest land uses within the\ncurrent City boundary. By comparison, Agriculture is the\ndominant land use within the Town of Verona.\n\nRESIDENTIAL CONTEXT\nOver the past decade, Verona has been one of the\n\nScenic Ridge Neighborhood, Source: Google Maps\n\nfastest growing jurisdictions in the larger Madison\nmetropolitan area. The City’s population increased by\n32% between the 2010 and 2020 U.S. Decennial Census.\nWith sustained housing pressures throughout Dane\nCounty and consistent new development, growth in the\nCity is expected to continue.\nThe City’s housing stock is a fundamental part of\naccommodating growth - without expanded housing, the\nCity cannot adequately grow. The diversity of housing\ntypes contributes to the community character and\ncreating distinctive areas in the City. Additionally, many\nfactors of housing contribute to the quality of life from\naffordability to access to services.

Data as of 15 May 2025\nEnvision Verona Comprehensive Plan\n\n65\n\n\fCommunity Profile | Existing Land Use and Market Conditions\n\nMulti-Family Housing\nThe number of rentals in Verona has more than doubled since 2016, going\nfrom 2,019 apartments at year-end 2016 to 4,207 as of Q4 2024. This kind\nof growth is in the top 1% nationally for communities with more than 1,000\nresidents and shows impressive demand for living in the City of Verona.\nThe majority of new multifamily construction since 2010 has been in units\nwith one bedroom or a studio unit (adding approximately 60 units annually\nsince 2010). These units are more cost-effective for developers to build and\noperate, and command more rent on a per square foot basis than larger\nunits. New construction across all property types also commands more rent\nthan most historic real estate, and this is especially true in the residential\nand apartment sector. Locally, rents have risen 19% (+$286) since preCOVID levels, even while the market saw a record number of units become\navailable, whereas in most markets the delivery of thousands of new rental\nunits would flatten or even potentially create negative rent growth. Local\ndevelopers claim they’ve seen less interest in larger units compared to\nthe studio and 1BR units, which could mean that is the market they will\ncontinue to pursue in coming years. These unit types are less popular with\n\nMill District Apartments\n\nfamilies and young couples.\n1,400\n1,200\n\n$1,778\n1,118\n\n$2,000\n$1,800\n$1,600\n\n1,000\n800\n\n$1,400\n972\n$1,221\n\n$1,000\n\n600\n\n$800\n$600\n\n400\n200\n\nAvg.

Senior housing construction can help\nwith allowing units to become available by creating\nunique, community-centered spaces for elders of the\ncommunity to move to, allowing them to move out of\ntheir current housing which may be better suited both\nfrom a price and size standpoint for a young family.\nIn particular, based on the feedback from Verona\nresidents, many are worried about long wait times for\nthe current senior housing stock and desire a more\ndiverse stock of senior-oriented housing, including 55+\ncommunities and different building typologies such as\ntownhomes and cottage-style developments.\n\nOakmont Senior Community, Source: Oakmont Senior Community Website\n\nEnvision Verona Comprehensive Plan\n\n67\n\n\fCommunity Profile | Existing Land Use and Market Conditions\n\nHousing Affordability\nIn general, affordable housing is defined as a household\npaying no more than 30 percent of its annual income on\nhousing. Due to multiple variables such as household\nincome, interest rates, number of dependents, and other\nhousing expenses, it is unrealistic to establish a fixed\nhome value in the City that is deemed affordable to\neveryone.\nHousing affordability in Verona is trending the wrong\ndirection, though this is a trend seen in markets\nacross the US of all sizes, types, and demographics.\n\nFigure 25: Housing Costs\n\nShare of Renters Paying 30% or more of Gross Rent as a\nPercentage of Household Income\n\nAs mentioned above, according to Zillow the median\n\n2010\n\ncost of market rate for-sale housing has increased\n\n2020\n\n#\n\n%\n\n#\n\n%\n\nmore than 45% across the last five years.

This rate outpaces the median\nincome increase of 22%.\n\nFigure 26: US Census DPO4\n\nConcurrently, rents rose 43% from 2010-2020, and have\ncontinued to rise since then. This is especially significant\nas the share of residents that are renting rose nearly\n5% from 2010-2020 (from 26% to 31%), and the share of\nrenters who are paying more than 30% of their income\nis now above 50%.\nRent-burdened refers to individuals who spend over\n30% of their income or higher on housing costs; those\nwho spend over 50% of their income or higher on\nhousing costs are considered severely burdened. In\naddition to adding renters, the average rent burden\nalso increased. Most notably, the percentage of renters\nspending 30% or more of their income increased by\n11%.\n\n4.5 out of 10\n68\n\nnew Verona residents were\nrenters from 2010 to 2020.\n\nState of Community Report\n\nFigure 27: Renter vs Owner Occupied\n\n\fCommunity Profile | Existing Land Use and Market Conditions\n\nHousing Policies\nWhen adopted, 2017 Wis.

An annual housing affordability\n\nfor the City was to be 80% single-unit construction and\n\nreport is required to be completed per § 66.10013 of\n\n20% multi-unit construction. This has since been revised\n\nWisconsin Statutes in analyzing housing development,\n\nby the City through the Residential Development Policy\n\nimpacts of regulation, and progress toward goals\n\n(Resolution No. R-12-029) which targets a construction\n\ncontained in the Housing Element of the City of Verona’s\n\nratio of 70% - 75% single-family housing to 25% - 30%\n\nComprehensive Plan.\n\nmulti-family housing - including a limit of 50 multi-\n\nThat report contains the following information:\n+\n\nAn inventory of new residential lots created, and\nunits approved for construction;\n\n+\n\nA list and map of undeveloped parcels zoned for\nresidential development;\n\n+\n\nA list of undeveloped parcels suitable for, but not\nzoned for, residential development; and\n\n+\n\nfamily units constructed per year.\nThere are notable exceptions to this policy, including\nage-restricted housing, downtown development, and\nmixed-use development. The Common Council may\ndeviate from this ratio based on the characteristics and\nlocation of individual developments including location,\namenity, and design characteristics.\n\nAn analysis of residential development regulations\n\nAs the City continues to expand outside of the City\n\nand their impact on the cost of new housing.\n\ncenter, more housing is needed as well as various types\n\nAs the City has continued to grow, several of the\npolicies that were implemented in the 2009 – 2030\nComprehensive Plan continue to be implemented. The\nHousing Section of the 2009 – 2030 Comprehensive Plan\npolicies included, “Continue to support higher-density\nresidential in-fill and redevelopment projects in the\nCity’s downtown area and in areas adjacent to Verona\n\nof housing. Multifamily units should be located along\nfuture transit corridors, major county highways, or\nregional bicycle trails. Duplexes and townhomes can be\ninterspersed in single-family neighborhoods but should\nbe located in proximity to a public park or green space.\nIdeally, these multifamily homes should have easy\naccess to green space, parkland, or conservation areas.\n\nAvenue”.

Since 2020, close to 400 building permits have\nbeen issued for various types of residential construction,\nranging from single-family homes to multi-unit senior\nhousing complexes. However, different kinds of future\nretail and office development, in particular, may lag in\ndemand without additional residential “rooftops” that\ncan support additional commercial activity. While there\nare infrastructure constraints, the east, southeast, and\nsouth portions of Verona are likely areas for future\ndevelopment, where there is already strong interest\nfrom developers and investors. Natural areas and the\ngrowing Epic Systems Corporation campus constrain\npotential development to the west and northwest.\n\nISSUE #5: HOUSING AND NEIGHBORHOODS\nVerona’s housing issues reflect, for the most part, what\n\nand forging partnerships with various for-profit and\nnonprofit housing developers can also serve as key\naction steps for adding new housing.\n\nISSUE #6: INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS\nThe City of Verona currently has adequate sanitary,\nwater, and stormwater system services within its\ncurrent built footprint. However, at some point, as the\nCity considers new development in its growth areas,\nnew investments in infrastructure, including sewer\nand water line extensions, lift stations, and water\ntowers, will be necessary. However, topography and\nland surface shapes in certain portions of the growth\nareas will impose significant costs on their placement\nand installation. As the City of Verona updates its 2015\nWater Systems Master Plan, which will inform future\ncapital improvement programming for infrastructure,\nprioritizing which growth areas should receive needed\ninfrastructure can help provide predictability in future\nland use decisions and financing arrangements that\nhelp underwrite and defray the costs of infrastructure\ninstallation.\n\nis occurring in many Dane County communities and\nnationally: that the current housing supply and housing\nproduct do not meet the needs of Verona’s various\nhousehold types, including housing for young families,\nseniors, and the workforce population. Overall, housing\naffordability is problematic, with the median cost of\nmarket-rate for-sale housing increasing by more than\n45% over the last five years, mirroring national trends.\nAs the Verona community plans for its growth, new\nresidential development that offers a mix of housing\noptions can help provide new living opportunities for a\nrange of households.

However,\nresidents still express a desire for more park spaces\nas well as extensions and improved connections to\nbike trails and pedestrian paths. When asked about\nwhat other park facilities and services are needed,\nVerona residents considered additional skating rinks,\npickleball courts, an outdoor pool, and more practical\nenhancements, such as public restrooms and better trail\nlighting, as essential priorities. Incorporating new parks\nand recreational facilities in developing residential areas\nwas also a key concern for Verona stakeholders.\n\nrealm appearances was a consistent subject matter for\nresidents and various stakeholder groups — mainly with\nnewer residential development designs that are not in\nscale with Verona’s more traditional Downtown district\nand neighborhoods.

SHEET - Dane County Population Projections 2020-2050\n\nAugust 2025\n\nBACKGROUND\nThe Wisconsin Department of Administration (DOA) prepares population projections for every jurisdiction in\nthe state, typically every 5 years. These projections are used by municipalities, utilities, employers, state\nagencies and others throughout the state to plan for the future. The projections inform land use and\ninfrastructure planning, business investment, and efforts to preserve farmland and natural resources.\nFueled by unique local assets, Dane County has experienced strong population growth for over 100 years. The\nrate of growth slowed after 1970 but has been consistently higher than DOA’s projections (see graph on next\npage). In response, some local entities develop their own projections to more accurately anticipate their\nneeds. The result is a patchwork of differing projections about our future growth.\nA “Regional Data Group” (RDG) of local planning and demography specialists\ngathered in 2024 and 2025 to research trends in population, housing, and jobs\nin the county. 1 The objectives of this work are 1) to establish a set of accurate\npopulation projections to inform local planning processes and 2) to encourage\nuse of these projections for local planning. The RDG intends to review and\nupdate these projections every five years.\n\nPOPULATION PROJECTION AND METHOD\nThe Regional Data Group estimates the Dane County 2050 population at\n887,000 residents.\nThis is about 325,000 more residents than the 2020 Census count of 561,504\n(a 58% increase). This represents 160,000 new housing units, not including the\nadditional units needed to correct for past underproduction, restore healthy\nvacancy rates and reduce pressure on home prices. 2\nThe analysis considered:\n•\n\nDOA projections assume a statewide decline in population, beginning\nthis decade, due to dropping birth rates and modest in-migration.\n\n•\n\nDOA’s projections show growth continuing in Dane County through\n2050, averaging 11.5% growth per decade. The rate of growth has only\nbeen that low in two decades during the past 125 years: 1900-1910\nand 1970-1980. In all other decades the growth rate ranged from\n13.5% to 31.1%.\n\n•\n\n•\n\nData on Dane County’s population, housing, and jobs over the past 40\nyears show exponential growth curves rather than straight-line trends.\nJobs have grown faster than population, with more workers living\noutside Dane County. Households have increased faster than housing\nunits, resulting in lower vacancy rates. 887,000 is the median value\namong separate projections based on trends in population, housing,\nand jobs. If we see this number of people in 2050 our growth rate will\nhave averaged 16.5% per decade, 2020-2050.\nThe Growth Factors described at right and a shift in local housing\ndevelopment policies due to the housing shortage are expected to\nsustain growth through 2050.\n\nGROWTH\nFACTORS\nJob growth in stable\nindustries, including\nhealthcare, education,\nadvanced\nmanufacturing, biomedical research, IT and\nprofessional and\nfinancial services,\nsupported by the\ncontinual influx of UW\nstudents.\nUW-Madison attracts\nstudents from around\nthe nation and world,\nsome of whom settle\nhere; UW Madison\nranked 6th in research in\nU.S., attracting\ninvestment in industries\nsupported by research.\nExceptional healthcare\nservices with five major\nhospitals and over a\ndozen clinics forming a\nregional healthcare hub.\nUrban and rural\namenities including\nwalking, biking and\ntransit infrastructure;\ncultural institutions; an\nattractive natural\nsetting; and world-class\nagriculture.\n\n1 The Regional Development Group (RDG) includes the Capital Area Regional Planning Commission (CARPC), the Greater Madison Metropolitan Planning\nOrganization (MPO), Dane County Planning, the City of Madison, and the UW-Madison Department of Planning and Landscape Architecture.\n2\n2010 to 2020, Dane County produced 8,000 fewer units than the number of new households, significantly reducing vacancy rates, Regional Housing\nStrategy, 2024.\n\n\fDANE COUNTY POPULATION – ACTUAL AND PROJECTED\n\n900,000\n800,000\n\n887,000\n\nThe DOA has been releasing population projections since 1978. For each\nset of projections (grey dots), there is a box with the year the projection\nwas issued and the difference between the projection and the actual or\nestimated population in that year. The DOA has consistently underprojected the Dane County population.\n\n767,000\n660,000\n\n779,265\n\nThe DOA issued new projections in 2024 (the blue diamonds at right).\n\n700,000\n600,000\n\nThe DOA also issues current population estimates each year. The 2025\npopulation estimate is 611,149, meaning the County has likely achieved\n75% of this decade’s DOA-projected population growth by 2025. At this\npace of growth, the 2030 population will exceed the DOA projection and\nbe approximately 660,000, as projected by the Regional Data Group.\n\n703,535\n\n611,149\n\n627,215\n\n561,504\n\n488,073\n\n500,000\n\n2013 DOA: -56,049\n2008 DOA: -18,232\n\n426,526\n\n2003 DOA: -56,301\n\n367,085\n\n400,000\n\n1998 DOA: -58,530\n\n323,545\n\n300,000\n\n1993 DOA: -72,989\n\n290,272\n\n1988 DOA: -168,514\n1983 DOA: -83,027\n1978 DOA: -93,140\n\n200,000\n100,000\n\n1970\n\n1975\n\n1980\n\n1985\n\nCensus (Total Population)\n\n1990\n\n1995\n\n2000\n\nPrior DOA Projections\n\n2005\n\n2010\n\n2015\n\n2024 DOA Projection\nPage 2 of 5\n\n2020\n\n2025\n\n2030\n\n2035\n\n2040\n\n2045\n\n2050\n\nProjected\nTrendRDG\n1970\n- 2050\nPoly.

of five. The RDG anticipates some additional growth in\nunincorporated areas by 2050 but is unable to predict where that growth will occur. The\n\"Unallocated Town Growth,” 5,080 additional residents by 2050, is added to the total for all\ntowns but is not assigned to any specific jurisdictions.\nTown Dissolutions: The Town of Madison was dissolved in 2022 and its territory and population distributed to the\nCities of Madison and Fitchburg by intergovernmental agreement. The Town of Blooming Grove is scheduled to be\ndissolved in 2027 by intergovernmental agreement and its territory and population absorbed by the City of Madison.\nThe Town of Burke is scheduled to be dissolved in 2036 by intergovernmental agreement and its territory and\npopulation absorbed by the City of Madison, City of Sun Prairie, and Village of DeForest. The population projections for\neach of the receiving municipalities incorporate these jurisdictional changes.\n\nTRENDS TO WATCH\nThe Regional Data Group will continue to monitor trends and conditions, offering updated local projections\nevery 5 years. Things to watch:\nClimate migration within the U.S. is anticipated but hard to predict. Wisconsin has been shown to be a relatively safe and\naffordable place to live, less vulnerable to extreme weather and risks to life and property from wildfires, hurricanes,\nextreme drought, etc. Will this drive growth here?\n\nHousehold size has been falling for various reasons, including economic instability and uncertainty for young adults, and a\nlarge population of older adults (baby boomers). Will household size rebound or continue to shrink, and how will this affect\nhousing demand and population?\nNational economic conditions affect growth and birth rates in a variety of ways. Will interest rates fall again?

OF VERONA HOUSING\nAFFORDABILITY REPORT\n\nReport Year 2024\nPermit Years 2022-2023\n\n\fWhispering Coves Concept Forward Development Group, LLC\n\nPrepared by:\nThis document was prepared by MSA Professional\nServices, Inc. with assistance from City Staff.\nProject No.: 09286047\n\n\fPurpose\nWhen adopted, 2017 Wis. Act 243 created new\nreporting requirements for some communities\nrelating to municipal housing stock. This Housing\nAffordability Report complies with all requirements\ncontained in § 66.10013 of Wisconsin Statutes\nin analyzing housing development, impacts of\nregulation, and progress toward goals contained\nin the Housing Element of the City of Verona’s\nComprehensive Plan.\n\nContents\nThis report contains the following information:\n•\n\nAn inventory of new residential lots created\nand units approved for construction\n\n•\n\nA list and map of undeveloped parcels\nzoned for residential development\n\n•\n\nA list of undeveloped parcels suitable for,\nbut not zoned for, residential development\n\n•\n\nAn analysis of residential development\nregulations and their impact on the cost of\nnew housing.\n\nHousing Affordability Report\n\nProcess and\nData\nZoning, assessment, land dedication, and\nordinance data are valid and current as of the\nposting of this report. Permit and development\nrecords, fee schedule, and assessment were\nprovided by City of Verona staff. This report must\nbe posted to the City’s website on a dedicated\nwebpage in accordance with State statute, and\nmay be distributed to all members of the Plan\nCommission and/or Council for transparency.\nSections of this report detail projected impact on\nsubdivision development based on the City’s fee\nschedule. While as accurate as possible, individual\nelements of each subdivision may change\napplicable fee amounts. General subdivision fee\nestimates should be used for purposes of estimate\nonly, and do not necessarily represent full fee\namounts for any future development proposal or\nproject type.\n\n3\n\n\fHousing\nDemand & Affordability\nOver the past decade, Verona has been one\nof the fastest growing jurisdictions in the larger\nMadison metropolitan area. The City’s population\nincreased by 32% between the 2010 and 2020\nU.S Decennial Census. This rate is consistent with\nthe anticipated growth forecasted in the City’s\nComprehensive Plan. With sustained housing\npressures throughout Dane County and consistent\nnew development, growth in the community is\npoised to continue.\nAccording to the U.S. Census 2022 American\nCommunity Survey 5-Year Estimates (ACS), a\nlittle more than half of all housing units (including\nvacant units) in the City are detached singleunit structures under owner-occupancy. Renter\nhouseholds make up 28% of all occupied\nhouseholds in the City, increasing as an overall\nshare of City households since 2010 (26%). This\nindicates that development of rental units has\noccurred at a rate higher than of ownership\nhousing in the past decade; although within the\nregion, Verona shows occupancy characteristics\nthat are near the average amongst other\nmunicipalities.\nThe Dane County Regional Housing Strategy,\nreleased in 2024, provides a regional framework for\nguiding housing policy in Dane County. The report\nprojects that Verona will have 9,115 households\nby 2040. Using the Wisconsin Department of\nAdministration projected household size of 2.34\nin 2040, this translates to 21,329 people living in\nthe City by 2040. The current average persons\nper household is 2.44 (2022 ACS), this figure\nis slightly above the average size of 5 other\nmunicipalities in the region (2.31) -- higher than\nMadison, Middleton, and Fitchburg, but lower than\nMcFarland and Waunakee.\nCurrent housing opportunities in the City indicate a\nwide range of structure types available to current\nand potential residents. Per the ACS Estimates,\nsingle-unit detached housing represents 54% of\nthe market for occupied housing units (74% of\nall owners and 4% of all renters), while 10+ unit\nstructures represent 24% of the occupied housing\nmarket (6% of all owners and 70% of all renters).\nMissing-middle housing types (1-unit attached\nto 9-unit structures) represent the remainder of\n4\n\nthe market - a sizable portion that largely serves\nrental households compared to owners (21% of all\nowners compared to 26% of all renters).\nTo meet the household projections cited in the\nDane County Regional Housing Strategy, the\nCity will need to add 3,404 housing units by 2040\n(9,442 projected total housing units by 2040). This\nis broken down into 3,064 housing units to match\nprojected growth, and 340 units to reach healthy\nvacancy rate (10%). Annual unit production\ntargets should be approximately 190 units per year\nto meet this goal. If the City desires to maintain\nthe current mix of unit types, this would equate to\napproximately 103 detached single-unit houses\nannually, with the remaining development\noccurring within multi-unit buildings.\nDue to regional housing market pressures and\nconsistent growth rates/unit production gaps in\nother municipalities, it is likely that even more\nconstruction will be necessary to maintain healthy\nmarkets and “affordability” within the City. While\nthere is no way to control market pressures in other\nregional municipalities, Verona has seen market\nspillover that has driven the ownership vacancy\nrate to 0%, below the level of a balanced market.\nThe rental vacancy rate increased to 7.6% in 2022\n(an increase from 1.4% in 2015 per ACS) - in the\nhealthy range and an indication that construction\nof rental units is keeping up with demand (though\nmore are needed as overall growth continues).\nMarket pressures have actively decreased\naffordability within the City - per ACS Estimates, the\nmedian gross rent increased from $1,008 in 2015\nto $1,407 in 2022 (6% annually), while ownership\nhome values have risen from $250,000 to $353,000\nover the same timeframe (6% annually). These cost\nincreases have impacted residents - 42% of renter\nhouseholds are paying more than 30% of their\nincome toward housing cost, having less income\nto put toward childcare, healthcare, groceries,\ntransportation, and other needs. At the same time,\nownership opportunities are increasingly shifting\ntoward exclusively high-income households,\nwith 88% of all ownership growth coming from\nhouseholds earning more than the metro’s median\nincome ($100,100 in 2020).\nCity of Verona\n\n\fHousing\nDemand & Affordability\nThe most recent data available from the US\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development\n(2021 ACS Estimates) indicates that 21% of all\nhouseholds in the City are “cost burdened”, paying\nmore than 30% of income toward housing costs,\ndown from 23.2% in 2018. This is a more acute\nproblem among lower-income households living in\nthe City, with cost burden identified as a housing\nissue for 75% of all households earning under 50%\nof the HUD Area Median Family Income (HAMFI)\n($62,950 annually for a family of 4 in 2024).\nThe chart below identiﬁes the difference between\nhousing units affordable at household income and\nunit affordability in the City. The City has a surplus\nof available units with housing costs affordable\nto households between 51%-80% AMI. Estimates\nindicate the City has nearly equal amount of\nhousing units affordable to 50% or below AMI as\nhouseholds earning under 50% AMI.\n\nThere is a significant shortage of higher-value\nhousing units affordable for households earning\n80% AMI and greater. This means that moderate\nto higher income owners and renters are buying\nor renting “down” within the market.

Comprehensive Plan (adopted 2010, reconfirmed 2019) contains four (4) goals, eight\n(8) objectives, and sixteen (16) policies directly related to the housing chapter of the Plan (not including\nappended area plans). Starting in 2024, the City will begin the process of updating the Comprehensive\nPlan.\n\nGoal 1 - Maintain the existing housing stock.\nObjective 1-A - Prevent existing housing stock\nfrom deteriorating.\nPolicy - Create, adopt, and enforce ‘property\nmaintenance’ ordinances for the City.\n\nGoal 2 - Continue to manage population growth.\nObjective 2-A - Continue to implement the\n‘Residential Phasing Plan’.\n\noptions within the City.\n\nObjective 3-A - Provide a mix of owner-occupied\nand rental housing.\nPolicy - Require all subdividers and developers\nto phase the construction of new housing so\nthat public infrastructure can keep pace with\nincreased demand.\nObjective 3-B - Provide a mix of single-family,\nduplex, and multi-family housing options.\n\nPolicy - Continue to limit the number of\nsingle-family and duplex parcels that can be\ndeveloped in the City during any year to limit\npopulation growth to a rate agreeable to the\nCouncil and the Verona Area School District\n\nPolicy - Encourage new developments to\ncontinue to provide a mix of single-family,\nduplex, and multi-family housing options to\naccomplish density and ‘mix/ratio’ of housingtype goals.\n\nPolicy - Modify the ‘Residential Phasing Plan’ so\nthat it also limits the number of new multi-family\nhousing units that can be created in the City\nduring any year to a) limit population growth\nto a rate agreeable to the Council and the\nVerona Area School District and b) maintain a\ndesired ratio of single-family/duplex housing to\nmulti-family housing in the city.\n\nPolicy - Consider allowing residential\ndevelopments that are exclusively multi-family\nor exclusively single-family when/if residential\ndevelopment elsewhere in the City can\n‘balance’ such a development to accomplish\nboth density and ‘mix/ratio’ goals within a\nreasonable timeframe.\n\nPolicy - Evaluate the ‘Residential Phasing Plan’\nand the number of units allowed (both single\nfamily/duplex and multi-family…) as the City\ngrows.\n\n6\n\nGoal 3 - Encourage a variety of new housing\n\nPolicy - Consider allowing multi-family housing\ndensities to exceed 12 units per acre only when\nvery high design and aesthetic criteria can be\nsatisfied and when the goals of the residential\nphasing plan can be accomplished.\n\nCity of Verona\n\n\fHousing Goals\nin the Comprehensive Plan\nObjective 3-C - Provide housing options for a\nrange of household incomes.\nPolicy - Diversify the City’s housing stock by\nproviding more high-end and ‘executive’ style\nhousing.\nPolicy - Diversify the City’s housing stock by\nproviding more affordable housing.\nPolicy - Continue to utilize the ‘Community\nResidential’ zoning district as a method\nto provide more affordable single-family\ndetached housing options within the city.\nPolicy - Investigate allowing accessory\napartments/dwelling units as a means of\nproviding additional affordable housing\noptions within the City.\n\nObjective 3-E - Provide housing options that\ndifferentiate Verona from Madison.\nPolicy - Provide a variety of housing options\nthat distinct/different from housing options\navailable in Madison.\n\nGoal 4 - Promote housing that is supportive of\nmass-transit.\n\nObjective 4-A - Promote higher density housing\nin the center of the City.\nPolicy - Continue to support higher-density\nresidential in-fill and redevelopment projects\nin the City’s downtown area and in areas\nadjacent to Verona Avenue.\n\nObjective 3-D - Provide housing options for\nspecial needs populations.\nPolicy - Continue to support residential\ndevelopment for special needs populations,\nincluding assisted living facilities; communitybased residential care facilities (CBRFs);\nretirement communities, age-restricted\nresidential developments, and residential care\napartment complexes (RCACs).\nPolicy - Proposed CBRF and RCAC facilities\nthat would not meet state-mandated minimum\nspacing requirements will continue to require\nCommon Council review and approval.\n\nMeeting Housing Goals\n\nThe City of Verona Comprehensive Plan contains several goals relating to housing affordability,\nrecognizing demand for households of all income levels. Notable policies directly state a need to diversify\nhousing stock by providing more affordable housing. The Residential Phasing Plan, which places limits on\nthe number of units that can be developed in one year, is a restriction of supply that can contribute to\nprice increases and affordability challenges. The phasing plan and it’s impact on affordability should be\nconsidered carefully during future Comprehensive Plan updates.\n\nHousing Affordability Report\n\n7\n\n\fResidential\nActivity\nIn 2022 and 2023, the City of Verona approved the following permits for residential unit development and\nalteration.\n\nResidential Permits Issued Last Year\nSubdivision Plats\nCertified Survey Maps\nCondo Plats\nBuilding Permits (1 & 2 Unit)\nAlteration Permits (1 & 2 Unit)\nMulti-Unit Residential\n\n2022\n0\n3\n2\n678\n96\n265\n\n2023\n3\n0\n0\n685\n95\n403\n\nDevelopment Considerations\n\nIn 2009, the Comprehensive Plan Committee wrote into policy that the desired mix of housing structure\ntypes for the City was to be 80% single-unit construction and 20% multi-unit construction. This has since\nbeen revised by the City through the Residential Development Policy (Resolution No. R-12-029) which\ntargets a construction ratio of 70% - 75% single-family housing to 25% - 30% multi-family housing - including\na limit of 50 multi-family units constructed per year. This may need to be adjusted to account for\nincreasing housing demand.\nThere are notable exceptions to this policy, including age-restricted housing, downtown development,\nand mixed-use development. The Common Council may deviate from this ratio based on the\ncharacteristics and location of individual developments including location, amenity, and design\ncharacteristics. Verona’s current housing unit mix is significantly lower than the plan’s projections as only\n54% are single-unit detached, 16% single-unit attached (duplex/twinhome or townhome units), and 30%\nmulti-unit.\n\nUnit Mix by Structure Type\n\n30%\nSingle-Unit Detached\nAttached/Townhome\n54%\n\n3+ Unit\n\n16%\n\n8\n\nCity of Verona\n\n\fFinancial Impact of\nFees on Development\nCity fees for new development are modeled below to illustrate impact on a hypothetical subdivision. For\npurposes of this illustration, these fees demonstrate cost for a development of 30 single family units and 16\nduplex units, all 3-bedroom units. Size of units is assumed to be 2,500 sqft. for single-family units and 1,500\nsqft. for duplex units (4,000 sqft. total). All building related costs are based on the City’s New Construction\nGroup No. 1, which includes all single-family and two-family units. On a per-unit basis, the average estimated City base fee is $4,780. This model is based off current Permit Fees posted as of January 1, 2022.\n\nHousing Affordability Report\n\n9\n\n\fAnalysis of\nDevelopment Regulations\nRegulation\n\nImprovements, Fees, and Dedications\n\nMulti- and mixed-use developments require\nconditional use permit (CUP) applications or\nplanned developments. The average approvals\nprocess for these applications generally takes\n90-100 days.

use by developers in\nengineering and construction could be provided\nto further simplify time and materials costs. Use of\nstandardized requirements reduces preparation\nand review time for development.\n\nMulti-unit development is permitted in mixed-use\nbuildings in the Central Commercial (CC) zoning\ndistrict and by CUP in the Suburban Commercial\n(SC) and Neighborhood Office (NO) zoning\ndistricts.\nCurrently, if a developer is requesting exemption\nfrom any code requirement (e.g. density and\nintensity requirements, bulk requirements,\nlandscaping requirements, and parking and\nloading requirements), the development\napplication must go through a Planned\nDevelopment process which consists of:\n• Pre-Application Conference with City staff.\n• Preliminary Plan Development submission to\nthe Plan Commission with a public hearing. The\nPlan Commission makes a recommendation to\nthe Common Council for the approval of any\nexemptions that were requested.\n• Final Plan Development submission to the Plan\nCommission. The Plan Commission makes a\nrecommendation to the Common Council\nthe approval of the project. If the final plan is\napproved by the Council, the applicant can\nproceed to obtain building permits and start\nconstruction of the project.\n\n10\n\nFees collected to offset impacts of development\non City services are standardized and reviewed\non an annual basis, though have remained largely\nconsistent year-over-year. Fees are generally in\nline with other area jurisdictions, and should be\nassessed for impact on the cost of development\nas part of the annual fee review process.\nAn additional consideration directly related to\nregulation, fees, and dedication is cost differences\nrelated to lot size. One of the ways to reduce the\ncost of development is through by-right regulatory\napproval of small lots. This can directly reduce cost\nof development through the share of land value\nattached to each unit. The average cost per\nsquare foot for the 11 undeveloped single-family\nlots that have completed streets and utility access\nis $12.00. The lowest assessed land value for a\nready-to-build lot is $91,500 for a 6,011 SF lot, or\nabout $15.22/SF. Though the cost per square foot\ngoes up as size is reduced, due to the relatively\nfixed costs and the relatively fixed value of a\nbuildable lot, the total cost generally does fall with\nreduced lot size.

SHEET\n\nAffordable Housing 101\nNew Rental\n\nWhat is Affordable Housing?\nHousing is considered affordable when a household spends less than 30% of their\ntotal monthly income on housing costs. A household is considered “cost-burdened”\nif they spend more than 30%, or “severely cost-burdened” if they spend 50%\nor more on housing—forcing lower-income households to choose between basic\nnecessities such as food, gas, clothing, school supplies, or medicine.\n\nWho Needs Affordable Housing?\n26% of all new housing production in Dane\nCounty is needed for moderate and lower\nincome households, these include:\n• Employers\n• Seniors\n\n• \u0007Families with\nchildren\n\n• Veterans\n\n• Child care providers\n\n• \u0007Home health care\nproviders\n\n• Young adults\n\n• School teachers\n\n• Lab technicians\n\n• Auto-mechanics\n\n• Firemen\n\nHow Much Does it Cost?\nAffordable multifamily provides housing at a\nprice range from 30% up to 80% of the Area\nMedian Income (AMI), also known as mixedincome housing. These developments typically\ninclude market rate units. All below market units\nare income restricted, and reviewed on an annual\nbasis. For example, 60% AMI for a family of four\nis $75,540 in Dane County. The two-bedroom\nrent limit (rent plus utilities) for a household at\n60% AMI is $1,700.\n\n46% of Dane\nCounty renters are costburdened, compared to\n21% of homeowners.\n\nTaylor Point, McFarland\nDevelopment includes 1, 2, and 3-bedroom units\nand a community and workout room. Sustainably\nbuilt to Wisconsin Green Built standards\nincluding EnergyStar appliances, LED lighting,\nand high-efficiency air conditioners.\n\nApproximately\n\n26,000 households,\nor 12% of overall\nhouseholds, are severely\ncost-burdened.\nOak Ridge Senior Apartments, Middleton\n\n26% of all new\nhousing demand is\nneeded for low-moderate\nincome households –\nwhich aligns with the\nnational demand.\n\n70 units of senior housing for households at\nor below 60% AMI. 9 units are for households\nat or below 30% AMI. 18 units for tenants with\ndisabilities or veterans requiring supportive\nservices, and 8 units are for grandparents who\nparent their grandchildren.\n\nWho Pays for it?\nNew affordable multifamily housing is made possible through public subsidies.\nThese subsidies include state and local funding for gap financing, land,\ntax-increment financing, TIF extension funds, and bonding.\n\nTo meet demand, Dane County Needs to Produce\n1,765 Affordable Units A Year – 1,000 more\nthan we are currently producing.\n\nLandsby Ridge, Mount Horeb\n51 units of housing serving families and\nindividuals with incomes of 30% – 60% AMI in\none, two, and three-bedroom units (including five\nmarket rate units). The property includes various\namenities and is adjacent to the Military Ridge\nState Trail.\n\n\fDemand for Affordable Housing\nThe chart below is an example of our housing shortage. The “big squeeze” shows\nthe renter supply gap, and how households that are lower income are forced to\ncompete with higher income households for low inventory.\n\nThe ‘Big Squeeze’\nLower- and higher- income households need to seek units affordable at other income brackets\n40,680\n\n24,880\n\n39,600\n\n25,310\n\n18,860\n14,940\n\n<30% AMI\n\nThe Limerick, Fitchburg\n\n7,510\n\n5,550\n\n3,930\n\n30-60% AMI\n\n60-100% AMI\n\nSource: HUD, ACS 5-Year Estimates (2016-2020), SB Friedman\n\n1,750\n\n100-150% AMI\nHOUSEHOLDS\n\n>150% AMI\nHOUSING UNITS\n\nMixed-income development with apartments\nand townhomes. Units include affordable senior\nhousing with 1 and 2 bedrooms; and 3 bedroom\ntownhome units open to all ages.\n\nHow Did We Get Here?\nBetween 2010 and 2020, Dane County added 42,000 new households but only\npermitted 34,000 new housing units, resulting in the underproduction of at\nleast 8,000 new units. According to the Cap Times, Madison home prices grew\nthe second fastest in the nation in 2023.\n\n1\n\nHousing Supply Shortage – Not enough units (low supply) = Higher prices\n\n2 Rising Development Costs – Building new housing is very costly\n3 \u0007Insufficient Household Income – Wages are not increasing at the same rate\nas housing costs.

Nearly half of new housing units are in larger multi-family buildings.\n9. Nearly half of new residents are renters, and the cost burden of renting\nhas gotten higher.\n10. Housing costs have increased faster than incomes.\n\nC: TRAILS, PARKS AND TRANSPORTATION\n11. Verona is a regional center for trails and parks.\n12. Despite great regional trails, Verona has gaps in access from trails to neighborhoods.\n13. Verona has concentrations of vehicular crashes all along Verona Ave. with a spike at Main\nSt. Additional hotspots occur along Northern Lights, McKee, Main and US 18 Ramps.\n14. Verona has regular rush hour traffic along Verona Ave.\n\nD: THE ECONOMY\n15. Most Verona employees (90%) do not live in Verona.\n16. Verona jobs are dominated by information and technology, largely impacted by the\nongoing growth of Epic.\n17. Job sectors outside of technology have grown as well, including Retail,\nAccommodation & Food Services, Business Support Services, and Manufacturing.\n\nENVISION\n\n\fPOPULATION GROWTH\n\nStation\n\n2A\n\nVerona is a growing City in a growing region.\n\nPOPULATION GROWTH\nFrom 2010 to 2020, the City of Verona grew\nfrom 10,600 to 14,000 people, an increase\nof 32%.

This is in\npart to the natural aging of the population, as well\nas new residents that moved to the area.\n\nPOPULATION ON\nBOTH ENDS OF THE\nSPECTRUM HAS\nINCREASED.\n\nVERONA HAS MORE\nFEMALE RESIDENTS\n\n2010\n2020\n\nFrom 2010 to 2020, the share of the population\nresidents that are women increased by 5%.\nWomen make up 55% of the City’s population.\n\nVERONA HAS MORE\nUNMARRIED RESIDENTS\n\nFemale\nMale\n\nMore Verona households are unmarried than were previously.\nIn particular, the number of unmarried households (single\nhouseholds) has increased 2x the rate of married households.\nAs a result, household size has decreased overall. Why does this\nmatter? A shift in household composition points to the demand for\nnew or different types of housing than were previously available.\n\n5%\nOF THE FEMALE\nPOPULATION HAS\nINCREASED SINCE 2010.\n\n2010\n2020\n\nINCOMES REMAIN HIGHER\nTHAN THE REGION\nFrom 2010 to 2020, the median income (the\nmiddle income of residents) increased by 22%\nfrom $78,500 to $96,000.

different housing types.\nHOUSING GROWTH HAS\nBEEN ON THE EXTREMES\n\n2010\n2020\n\nFrom 2010 to 2020, new housing units were\nlargely smaller multi-family units or larger\nsingle-family homes.\n\n1 BR & 4 BR\nUNITS HAVE INCREASED\nMORE THAN OTHERS.\n\nUnit Size\n4 bedroom units made up 34% of new units\nwhile 1-bedrooms made up an additional\n36% of new units. Despite being the majority\nof the historic housing stock, 2-bedroom and\n3-bedroom units slightly increased.\n\n2010\n2020\n\nHousing Type\nDetached, single-family homes made up\n28% of new units, while 10+ unit apartment\nbuildings made up 48%. Mid-density housing\ntypes from attached townhomes to duplex\nincreased only slightly and remain a small\nshare of Verona’s housing.\n\nMORE RENTERS AND A\nHIGHER COST OF HOUSING\nFrom 2010 to 2020, nearly half of all new\nresidents were renters. This led to an increase\nof the renter population by 5% over that\ndecade. Overall, 31% of residents are renters.\n\n10+ UNITS\nTHERE HAS BEEN A\nSIGNIFICANT INCREASE\nIN BUILT OUT OF HOUSING\nUNITS WITH 10-20+ UNITS.\n\n4.5 OUT OF 10\nNEW VERONA RESIDENTS WERE\nRENTERS FROM 2010 TO 2020.\n\n2010\n2020\n\nRent Burden\nRent-burdened refers to individuals who\nspend over 30% of their income or higher on\nhousing costs; those who spend over 50% of\ntheir income or higher on housing costs are\nconsidered severely burdened. In addition to\nadding renters, the average rent burden also\nincreased. Most notably, the percentage of\nrenters spending 30% or more of their income\nincreased by 11%.\nHousing Costs\nThe cost of purchasing a home in Verona has\nalso increased. While this is partly due to\nnational rates of inflation, median home prices\nincreased from $250,000 in 2010 to $320,000\nin 2020, an increase of 25%. This rate outpaces\nthe median income increase of 22%.\n\n2010\n2020\n\nHOUSEHOLDS PAYING MORE THAN 30% OF THEIR\nINCOME TO RENT INCREASED FROM 380 TO 810.\n\nENVISION\n\n\fGROWTH POTENTIAL\n\nStation\n\n2B\n\nFuture growth of the City is limited by utilities, roadway access,\nand environmental conditions.\nWHAT ARE THE OPPORTUNITIES\nFOR THE CITY TO GROW\nGrowth is multi-faceted.
